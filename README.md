# SRG Collection Manager

Android app for managing your SRG (Super Ring of Glory) wrestling card collection and building decks.

## Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **Bundled Database** - ✨ App ships with 3,922 cards pre-loaded (ready to use immediately!)
- **Bundled Images** - ✨ 3,481 card thumbnail images (34MB) bundled with app for offline use
- **4-Tab Navigation** - Clean bottom nav: Collection | Decks | Card Search | Settings
- **Folder-Based Collection Management** - Organize cards in custom folders (Owned, Wanted, Trade, + custom)
- **Card Database Sync** - Sync from get-diced.com to get latest cards and updates (Settings screen)
- **Advanced Card Search** - Search with type-specific filters (attack type, play order, division, etc.)
- **Standalone Card Browse** - Browse and view any card before adding to collection
- **Multi-Folder Support** - Same card can exist in multiple folders with independent quantities
- **Offline-First** - Works offline with bundled database + images, sync for latest updates
- **7 Card Types Supported** - MainDeck, SingleCompetitor, TornadoCompetitor, TrioCompetitor, Entrance, Spectacle, CrowdMeter
- **Image Loading** - Coil library with bundled assets → cached downloads → server fallback

**Note:** New cards are released regularly (~10/month) and the database is actively being updated. The bundled database provides a great starting point, but syncing is recommended to get the latest cards and updates.

### 🚧 In Progress
- **Image Integration** - Integrating card images into UI components
- **Image Sync** - Background download of new/missing images from server

### 🔜 Coming Soon
- **Versioned Database Bundles** - Download latest versioned DB + images bundle from get-diced.com
- **Deckbuilding** - Build and manage decks with smart suggestions
- **Deck Export/Import** - Share decks via get-diced.com API
- **Shared Lists** - Import collection/deck links from get-diced.com
- **Folder Sorting** - Sort cards within folders (by name, type, deck #, etc.)
- **Folder Search** - Search within specific collection folders

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** - Primary language (100% Kotlin codebase)
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern UI toolkit with Material 3

## Database Schema (v2)

### Folders Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE folders (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- Folder ID (owned, wanted, trade, or UUID)
    name TEXT NOT NULL,             -- Display name
    is_default INTEGER NOT NULL,    -- 1 for Owned/Wanted/Trade, 0 for custom
    display_order INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Sort order
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL     -- Timestamp
);
```

### Cards Table (synced from get-diced.com)
```sql
CREATE TABLE cards (
    db_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,       -- Card UUID from API
    name TEXT NOT NULL,             -- Card name
    card_type TEXT NOT NULL,        -- MainDeckCard, SingleCompetitorCard, etc.
    rules_text TEXT,                -- Card rules
    errata_text TEXT,               -- Official errata
    is_banned INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- Banned status
    release_set TEXT,               -- Release set name
    tags TEXT,                      -- Comma-separated tags
    -- Competitor fields (nullable)
    power INTEGER, agility INTEGER, strike INTEGER,
    submission INTEGER, grapple INTEGER, technique INTEGER,
    division TEXT, gender TEXT,
    -- MainDeck fields (nullable)
    deck_card_number INTEGER, atk_type TEXT, play_order TEXT,
    synced_at INTEGER NOT NULL      -- Last sync timestamp
);
```

### FolderCards Junction Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE folder_cards (
    folder_id TEXT NOT NULL,        -- FK to folders.id
    card_uuid TEXT NOT NULL,        -- FK to cards.db_uuid
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- Number of copies
    added_at INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- Timestamp
    PRIMARY KEY (folder_id, card_uuid),
    FOREIGN KEY (folder_id) REFERENCES folders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (card_uuid) REFERENCES cards(db_uuid) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Building the App

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Android Studio Ladybug or later (2024.2.1+)
   - JDK 21
   - Android SDK 34

2. **Bundle Images** (optional, images already bundled):
   ```bash
   IMAGE_SOURCE_DIR=~/data/srg_card_search_website/backend/app/images ./bundle_images.sh
   ```

3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

4. **Run**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

## How to Use

### 1. First Time Setup
   - Launch the app
   - **3,922 cards + 3,481 images are pre-loaded and ready to use immediately!**
   - Navigate to **Settings** tab (bottom right)
   - **Recommended:** Tap **Sync from get-diced.com** to get latest cards
   - New cards are released regularly (~10/month), so periodic syncing keeps your database current

### 2. Organize Your Collection with Folders
   - View default folders: **Owned**, **Wanted**, **Trade**
   - Create custom folders with the **+** button
   - Tap any folder to view its contents
   - Delete custom folders (default folders cannot be deleted)

### 3. Add Cards to Folders
   - Open a folder → Tap **+** button
   - Search by card name or rules text
   - Use filters: Card Type, Attack Type, Play Order, Division
   - Select a card and enter quantity
   - Same card can be in multiple folders with different quantities

### 4. Manage Cards in Folders
   - Tap **Edit** icon to change quantity
   - Tap **Delete** icon to remove from folder
   - Cards remain in database even when removed from all folders

### 5. Build Decks *(coming soon)*
   - Create and name your deck
   - Search and add cards
   - Get smart suggestions for linked cards
   - Export/share via get-diced.com
